## Overview of this repository

### Main folders

* ``rustls-kemtls``: modified Rustls TLS stack to implement KEMTLS
* ``rustls-pqtls``: Rustls with support for KEM kex and PQ signature schemes
* ``measuring``: The scripts to measure the above
* ``ring``: Modified version of Ring to work with KEMs and PQ signatures
* ``webpki``: Modified version of WebPKI to work with PQ and KEM public keys in certificates
* ``mk-cert``: Utility scripts to create post-quantum PKI for pqtls and KEMTLS

### Supporting repositories

* ``oqs-rs``: Rust wrapper around ``liboqs``.
    * ``oqs-rs/oqs-sys/liboqs`` is a version of ``liboqs`` with additional (AVX2) implementations
* ``pqcrypto``: Rust wrappers around ``PQClean``
    * ``pqcrypto/pqclean``: Modified version of PQClean with additional (AVX2) implementations
* ``mk-cert/xmss-rs``: Rust wrapper around the XMSS reference code, with our custom parameter set (``src/settings.rs``) and utilities for keygen and signing.
* ``csidh-rust``: Rust wrapper around the Meyer, Campos, Reith constant-time implementation of CSIDH.

### Miscelaneous dependencies

* ``tls-hacking``: Contains a generator for the ``src/msgs/enums.rs`` file in ``rustls``.
    Updating `enums.rs` is needed to add cryptographic primitives. The generator helps keeping enums in sync.

## Working with this repository

* **MAKE SURE TO CLONE WITH __ALL__ SUBMODULES**. There are submodules _within_ submodules, so clone with ``--recurse-submodules``.
* The Dockerfile serves as an example of how everything can be compiled and how test setups can be created.
   It is used by the ``./measuring/script/create-experimental-setup.sh`` script, which serves as an example of its use.
* The `mk-certs` folder contains a python script, `encoder.py`, that can be used to create the required PKI.
   RSA certificates and X25519 certificates are available in subfolders.
   The certificates assume that the server hostname is ``servername``.
* Experimenting with ``rustls-pqtls`` or ``rustls-kemtls`` can be done directly; use the ``rustls-mio`` subfolders
   and run ``cargo run --example tlsserver -- --help`` or ``cargo run --example tlsclient -- --help``.
* The measurement setup is handled in the `measuring/` folder. See the `./run_experiment.sh` script.
* Processing of results is done by the `./scripts/process.py` folder. It expects a `data` folder as produced by `./scripts/experiment.py`.
* Downloading archived results can be done through the scripts in ``measuring/archived-results/``
