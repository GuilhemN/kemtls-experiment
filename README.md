## Overview of this repository

### Main folders

* ``rustls-kemtls``: modified Rustls TLS stack to implement KEMTLS and post-quantum versions of "normal" TLS 1.3
* ``measuring``: The scripts to measure the above
* ``ring``: Modified version of Ring to allow for longer DER-encoded strings than typically expected from TLS instances.
* ``webpki``: Modified version of WebPKI to work with PQ and KEM public keys in certificates
* ``mk-cert``: Utility scripts to create post-quantum PKI for pqtls and KEMTLS.

### Supporting repositories

* [``oqs-rs``][]: Rust wrapper around ``liboqs``.
* ``mk-cert/xmss-rs``: Rust wrapper around the XMSS reference code, with our custom parameter set (``src/settings.rs``) and utilities for keygen and signing.
* ``csidh-rust``: Rust wrapper around the Meyer, Campos, Reith constant-time implementation of CSIDH.

## Working with this repository

* **MAKE SURE TO CLONE WITH __ALL__ SUBMODULES**. There are submodules _within_ submodules, so clone with ``--recurse-submodules``.
* The Dockerfile serves as an example of how everything can be compiled and how test setups can be created.
   It is used by the ``./measuring/script/create-experimental-setup.sh`` script, which serves as an example of its use.
* The `mk-certs` folder contains a python script, `encoder.py`, that can be used to create the required PKI.
   RSA certificates and X25519 certificates are available in subfolders.
   The certificates assume that the server hostname is ``servername``, so put this in your `/etc/hosts`.
   Alternatively, override it using the environment variables in the file (which is also how you set which algorithms are used).
* Experimenting with ``rustls`` can be done directly; use the ``rustls-mio`` subfolders
   and run ``cargo run --example tlsserver -- --help`` or ``cargo run --example tlsclient -- --help``.
* The measurement setup is handled in the `measuring/` folder. See the `./run_experiment.sh` script.
* Processing of results is done by the `./scripts/process.py` folder. It expects a `data` folder as produced by `./scripts/experiment.py`.
* Downloading archived results can be done through the scripts in ``measuring/archived-results/``
